=== Detailed Description
    This handler is built on the AWS API, and is used to delete a security group. If you
    attempt to delete a security group that is associated with an instance, or
    is referenced by another security group, the operation fails with
    InvalidGroup.InUse in EC2-Classic or DependencyViolation
    in EC2-VPC.For more information see the AWS Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User
    Guide online.

    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
