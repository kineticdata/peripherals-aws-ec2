== AWS EC2 Run Instances
    This handler is used to Launch the specified number of instances using
    an AMI for which you have permissions.

=== Parameters
    [Dry Run]
      Dry run validates user permissions and inputs without completing the EC2
      action (true or false).
    [Image ID]
      The ID of the AMI.
    [Minimum Instance Count]
      The minimum number of instances to launch. If you specify a minimum that
      is more instances than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability
      Zone, Amazon EC2 launches no instances.
    [Maximum Instance Count]
      The maximum number of instances to launch. If you specify more instances
      than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2
      launches the largest possible number of instances above MinCount.
    [Key Name]
      The name of the key pair. Linux instances have access to the public key
      of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to
      the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure
      access without passwords. For more information, see Key Pairs in the Amazon
      Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
    [Security Groups]
      One or more security group names, separated by commas. For a nondefault
      VPC, you must use Security Group IDs instead.
    [Security Group IDs]
      One or more security group IDs, separated by commas.
    [User Data]
      The Base64-encoded MIME user data for the instances.
    [Instance Type]
      The instance type. For more information, see Instance Types in the Amazon
      Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. If not provided the AWS default is
      m1.small.
    [Placement]
      The placement for the instance. Format: {&quot;availability_zone&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;,&quot;group_name&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;,&quot;tenancy&quot;:&quot;default|dedicated&quot;}
    [Kernel ID]
      The ID of the kernel. AWS recommends that you use PV-GRUB instead of
      kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see PV-GRUB in the Amazon
      Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
    [Ramdisk ID]
      The ID of the RAM disk. AWS recommends that you use PV-GRUB instead of
      kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see PV-GRUB in the Amazon
      Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
    [Block Device Mapping]
      The block device mapping. Format: [{&quot;virtual_name&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;,&quot;device_name&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;,&quot;ebs&quot;:{&quot;snapshot_id&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;,&quot;volume_size&quot;:some integer,&quot;delete_on_termination&quot;:true|false,&quot;volume_type&quot;:&quot;standard|iol|gp2&quot;,&quot;iops&quot;:&quot;some integer&quot;,&quot;encrypted&quot;:true|false},&quot;no_device&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;},...]
    [Monitoring]
      true or false. The monitoring for the instance.
    [Subnet ID]
      The ID of the subnet to launch the instance into.
    [Disable API Termination]
      true or false. If you set this parameter to true, you can't terminate the
      instance using the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API; otherwise, you can.
      If you set this parameter to true and then later want to be able to
      terminate the instance, you must first change the value of the
      disableApiTermination attribute to false using ModifyInstanceAttribute.
      Alternatively, if you set InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior to terminate,
      you can terminate the instance by running the shutdown command from the
      instance.
    [Instance Initiated Shutdown Behavior]
      Accepts 'stop' or 'terminate'.  Indicates whether an instance stops or
      terminates when you initiate shutdown from the instance (using the
      operating system command for system shutdown). AWS default if not
      provided: stop
    [Private IP Address]
      The primary IP address. If not provided, AWS selects an IP address from
      the IP address range of the subnet. Note: This cannot be used in
      conjunction with setting a provide ip address as primary in the network
      interfaces input structure.
    [Client Token]
      Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempotency
      of the request.
    [Network Interfaces]
      One or more network interfaces. Format: [{&quot;network_interface_id&quot;:&quot;some_value&quot;,&quot;device_index&quot;:some_integer,&quot;subnet_id&quot;:&quot;some_value&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;some_value&quot;,&quot;private_ip_address&quot;:&quot;some_value&quot;,&quot;groups&quot;:[&quot;some value&quot;,&quot;some_other_value&quot;,&quot;yet_some_other_value&quot;],&quot;delete_on_termination&quot;:true | false,&quot;private_ip_addresses&quot;:[{&quot;private_ip_address&quot;:&quot;some_value&quot;,&quot;primary&quot;:true|false}],&quot;secondary_private_ip_address_count&quot;:some_integer,&quot;associate_public_ip_address&quot;:true|false},{another entry}]
    [IAM Instance Profile]
      The IAM instance profile. Format: {&quot;arn&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;}
    [EBS Optimized]
      true or false. Indicates whether the instance is optimized for EBS I/O.
      This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an
      optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O performance.
      This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional
      usage charges apply when using an EBS-optimized instance. If not provided,
      the AWS default is false.

=== Results
    [Reservation ID]
      Reservation of ID EC2 run instances.
    [Owner ID]
      Owner ID of EC2 run instances.
    [Requester ID]
      Requester ID of EC2 run instances.
    [Groups XLM]
      Groups XLM of EC2 run instances.
    [Groups String]
      Groups String of EC2 run instances.
    [Instances XML]
      Instances XML of EC2 run instances.
    [Instances String]
      Instances String of EC2 run instances.

=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the AWS REST API Launch the specified number of
    instances using an AMI for which you have permissions.  For more information
    see the AWS Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide online.

    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
