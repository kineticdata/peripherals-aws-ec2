=== Authentication
This handler requires two info values for AWS authentication: Access Key ID and
the Secret Access Key. These are analogous to username and password.

To find authentication values from the AWS account:

  1. Navigate to the following URL: https://aws.amazon.com/account/
  2. Click the "Security Credentials" link (if you are not logged in, you will
     be prompted to do so).
  3. Click the "Access Credentials" link.  Here you will find a list of your
     Access Keys.
  5. Use the Access Key ID to configure the access_key_id info value of this
     handler.
  6. To retrieve the Secret Access Key, click the "Show" link next to the Access
     Key ID that will be used.
  7. Use the Secret Access Key to configure the secret_access_key info value of
     this handler.

=== Results
[Previous Status]
  The state of the machine instance prior to the start request being issued.
[Current Status]
  The state of the machine instance after the start request. The state will
  typically be "pending".

=== Detailed Description
The start_instance function can be executed against any valid instance in any
state. When executed against an already started instance, the Previous Status
and Current Status will both be "running".
