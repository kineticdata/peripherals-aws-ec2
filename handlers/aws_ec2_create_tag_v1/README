      will be overwritten.

==== Sample Configuration
    Dry Run:               False
    Resource:              Test User
    Key:                   Owner
    Value:                 DBAdmin

=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the AWS REST API. Creates a single tag against a single
    resource. Will overwrite an existing tag with the same key.  Note: Per AWS,
    each resource can have a maximum of 10 tags.

    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
