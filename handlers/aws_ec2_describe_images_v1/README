=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the AWS REST API to Describe one or more of the images
    (AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs) available to you. Images available to you include
    public images, private images that you own, and private images owned by
    other AWS accounts but for which you have explicit launch permissions.
    For more information see the AWS Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
    User Guide online.
    
    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
