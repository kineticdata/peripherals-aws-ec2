=== Detailed Description
  This handler uses the AWS REST API to create a VPC for AWS. The input takes
  a CIDR and an Instance Tenancy options as input values. For Instance Tenancy,
  a value of 'default' means that instances can be launched with any tenancy;
  a value of 'dedicated' means all instances launched into the VPC are launched
  as dedicated tenancy instances regardless of the tenancy assigned to the
  instance at launch. Dedicated tenancy instances run on single-tenant hardware.

  The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
  true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
  handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
  proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
  not have proper permissions.
