=== Detailed Description
    This handler is used to create a security group in AWS.  A security group is for use with instances
    either in the EC2-Classic platform or in a specific VPC.  For more information see the Amazon Elastic
    Compute Cloud User Guide and the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide online.

    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
