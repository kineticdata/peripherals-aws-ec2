=== Detailed Description
  Creates a 2048-bit RSA key pair with the specified name. Amazon EC2 stores the
  public key and displays the private key for you to save to a file. The private
  key is returned as an unencrypted PEM encoded PKCS#8 private key. If a key
  with the specified name already exists, Amazon EC2 returns an error. For more
  information about key pairs, see the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide
  online.

  The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
  true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
  handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
  proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
  not have proper permissions.
