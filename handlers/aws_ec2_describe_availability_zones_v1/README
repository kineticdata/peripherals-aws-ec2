== AWS EC2 Describe Availability Zones
    Returns a set of availability zones and details for each of those zones.

=== Parameters
  [Dry Run]
    Dry run validates user permissions and inputs without completing the EC2
    action (true or false).
  [Zone Names]
    The names of one or more availability zones, comma separated. Leave blank to
    return data on all availability zones.

=== Results
    [Availability Zone Names]
      A comma separated list of availability zone names that were returned
    [Availability Zone Details]
      A JSON object containing the availability zone details in the form of
      {"zone1": {"name": "zone1","region_name"...}, "zone2": ...}

==== Sample Configuration
Dry Run:                  false
Zone Names:               us-east-1a,us-east-1b

=== Detailed Description
Returns a set of availability zones and details for each of those zones. If no
availability zones are specified in the input, all zones and their details are
returned. The zone details are returned as a JSON object that maps the zone
names to another JSON object containing the zone details. The available details
are currently 'zone_name','state','region_name', and 'messages'.

The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
not have proper permissions.
