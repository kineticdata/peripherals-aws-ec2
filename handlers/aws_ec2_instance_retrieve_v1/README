== AWS_EC2_Instance_Retrieve
This handler returns a list of properties for the specified EC2 machine
instance.

For more information, see the Detailed Description section below.

=== Parameters
[Instance ID]
  The instance id of the EC2 virtual machine that this handler will retrieve 
  details about

==== Sample Configuration
Instance ID::  <%= @answers['Instance ID'] %>

=== Authentication
This handler requires two info values for AWS authentication: Access Key ID and
the Secret Access Key. These are analogous to username and password.

To find authentication values from the AWS account:

  1. Navigate to the following URL: https://aws.amazon.com/account/
  2. Click the "Security Credentials" link (if you are not logged in, you will
     be prompted to do so).
  3. Click the "Access Credentials" link.  Here you will find a list of your
     Access Keys.
  5. Use the Access Key ID to configure the access_key_id info value of this
     handler.
  6. To retrieve the Secret Access Key, click the "Show" link next to the Access
     Key ID that will be used.
  7. Use the Secret Access Key to configure the secret_access_key info value of
     this handler.

  instance.
[Architecture]

[Instance State]
  The state of the EC2 instance.

=== Detailed Description

The describe_instances function is the base AWS::EC2 gem call we are using for
this handler and returns a multi-level hash/array nest with a top level hash key
of "reservationsSet".

The reservationSet has the following pseudo-xml form. Elements with the <item> 
tag are array members and are referenced by numerical index.

All others are hash members and are references by element/key name.

<reservationsSet>
 <reservationId/)
  <requesterId/>,
 <item>
    <groupSet>
      <item">
        <groupId/>
      </item>
     </groupSet>
    <instancesSet>
      <item>
        <blockDeviceMapping>
          <item>
            <ebs>
               <attachTime/>,
               <status/>,
               <deleteOnTermination/>,
               <volumeId/>,
               <deviceName>
             </ebs>
           </item>
         <tagSet>
           <item>
             <value/>
             <key/>
            </item>
          </tagset>,
          <virtualizationType/>,
          <productCodes/>
          <ipAddress/>,
          <kernelId/>
          <amiLaunchIndex/>
          <clientToken/>,
          <privateIpAddress>,
          <keyName/>",
          <launchTime>,
          <instanceType/>,
          <imageId/>,
          <privateDnsName/>,
          <rootDeviceName/>,
          <rootDeviceType/>
          <monitoring/>",
          <reason/>,
          <placement/>
          <dnsName/>,
          <instanceId/>,
          <instanceState>
             <name/>
             <code/>
           </instanceState>
        </item>
      </instanceSet>
    </item>
  </reservationSet>,

To retrieve the imageId, for example, simply flatten the above structure by 
removing inapplicable items

<reservationsSet>
  <item>
     <instancesSet>
      <item>
          <imageId/>,
        </item>
      </instanceSet>
    </item>
  </reservationSet>

Treat items as arrays and all other members as hash keys.  Doing so, we can
reference imageId value in the following manner:

@base_aws_object.reservationSet.item[index].instancesSet.item[index].imageId

In this handler, we are returning just the more interesting properties for an
instance. Future versions may incorporate additional properties.
