AWS EC2 Delete Route Table
    This handler deletes a specified route table.

=== Parameters
  [Dry Run]
    Dry run validates user permissions and inputs without completing the EC2
    action (true or false).
  [Route Table ID]
    The ID of the route table to delete.

=== Results
  This handler returns no results

==== Sample Configuration
    Dry Run:            false
    Route Table ID:     rtb-076baa09

=== Detailed Description
    This handler deletes an associate subnet with a route table. The subnet and
    route must be in the same VPC. You must disassociate the route table
    from any subnets before you can delete it.  You cannot delete the main route
    table. This association causes traffic originating from the subnet to be
    routed according to the routes in the route table. A route can be associated
    with multiple subnets. For more information see the AWS Amazon Virtual
    Private Cloud User Guide online.

    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
