    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
