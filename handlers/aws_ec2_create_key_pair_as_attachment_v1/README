=== Detailed Description
Creates a 2048-bit RSA key pair with the specified name. Amazon EC2 stores the
public key and displays the private key for you to save to a file. The returned
private key is then uploaded to the configured Kinetic Filehub for the specified
Kinetic Request CE instance (using the Request API to start that upload). Once
the key has been uploaded to Filehub, the key pair will be attached to the
specified field in a new Request CE submission. The Id for that created
submission will be returned by the handler.

The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
not have proper permissions.
