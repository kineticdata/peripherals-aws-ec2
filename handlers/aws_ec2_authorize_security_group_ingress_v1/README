== AWS EC2 Authorize Security Group Ingress V1
    Add a security group ingress rule to a security group.

=== Parameters
  [Dry Run]
    Dry run validates user permissions and inputs without completing the EC2
    action (true or false).
  [Group Name]
    The name of the security group. Normally used for the EC2-Classic or the
    default VPC security group. Must match an existing value in AWS.
  [Group Id]
    The ID of the security group. Required for a non-default VPC.
  [Source Security Group Name]
    The name of the source security group. For EC2-VPC, the source security
    group must be in the same VPC.
  [Source Security Group Owner Id]
    The AWS account number for the source security group. For EC2-VPC, the
    source security group must be in the same VPC. Creates rules that grant full
    ICMP, UDP, and TCP access. To create a rule with a specific IP protocol and
    port range, use a set of IP permissions instead.
  [IP Protocol]
    The IP protocol name (tcp, udp, icmp). (VPC only) Use -1 to specify all. You
    can't specify this parameter when specifying a source security group.
  [From Port]
    The start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number.
    For the ICMP type number, use -1 to specify all ICMP types. You can't
    specify this parameter when specifying a source security group.
  [To Port]
    The end of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code number.
    For the ICMP code number, use -1 to specify all ICMP codes for the ICMP type.
    You can't specify this parameter when specifying a source security group.
  [CIDR IP Address Range]
    The CIDR IP address range. You can't specify this parameter when specifying
    a source security group.

=== Results

==== Sample Configuration
    Dry Run:                        false
    Group Name:                     DevGroup
    Group ID:                       sg-94a22af0
    Source Security Group Name:
    Source Security Group Owner ID:
    IP Protocol:                    tcp
    From Port:                      22
    To Port:                        23
    CIDR IP Address Range:          0.0.0.0/0

=== Detailed Description
This handler uses the AWS REST API to Add a security group ingress rule to a
security group. This handler implements a subset of the full AWS call (single
rule submission only). Most of the inputs for this handler are conditionally
required based on other input values. Source Security Group Name is required
if a CIDR IP Address Name isn't specified and vice versa. Also, if a Source
Security Group Name and/or Source Security Group Owner ID are provided, the
IP Protocol, From Port, To Port, and CIDR IP Address Range must be left blank.
This handler returns no results, so if no errors are caught and raised the rule
has been successfully applied.

More specific information about these parameters can be found in the Amazon EC2
Ruby documentation (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/EC2/Client.html#authorize_security_group_ingress-instance_method)
and in the EC2 REST documentation (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group-ingress.html).

The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
not have proper permissions.
