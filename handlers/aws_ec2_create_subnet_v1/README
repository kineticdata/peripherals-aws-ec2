== AWS EC2 Create Subnet
    Creates a subnet in an existing VPC.

=== Parameters
  [Dry Run]
    Dry run validates user permissions and inputs without completing the EC2
    action (true or false).
  [VPC Id]
    The ID of the VPN in which the subnet will be created. Must match an
    existing value in AWS.
  [CIDR Block]
    The network range for the subnet, in CIDR notation. For example: 10.0.0.0/24.
    After a subnet is created, the CIDR block cannot be changed. The subnet's
    CIDR Block can be the same as the VPC's CIDR block, or a subset of the VPC's
    CIDR block. If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the subnets' CIDR
    blocks must not overlap. The smallest subnet you can create uses a /28 netmask
    (16 IP addresses), and the largest uses a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses).
  [Availability Zone]
    The availability zone for the subnet

=== Results
  [Subnet Id]
    The ID of the subnet
  [Subnet State]
    The current state of the subnet
  [Subnet VPC Id]
    The ID of the VPC the subnet is in
  [Subnet CIDR Block]
    The IPv4 CIDR block assigned to the subnet
  [Subnet Available IP Address Count]
    The number of unused private IPv4 addresses in the subnet
  [Subnet Availability Zone]
    The Availability Zone of the subnet
  [Subnet Default for AZ]
    A boolean indicating whether this is the default subnet for the Availability
    Zone
  [Subnet Map Public IP on Launch]
    A boolean indicating whether instances launched in this subnet receive a
    public IPv4 address
  [Subnet Tags]
    Any tags assigned to the subnet

==== Sample Configuration
Dry Run:                         false
VPC Id:                          vpc-b7e2b6d2
CIDR Block:                      10.0.0.0/28
Availability Zone:               us-west-2a

=== Detailed Description
    Creates a subnet in an existing VPC. For more information see the AWS Amazon
    Virtual Private Cloud User Guide online.

    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
