== 0.6

- This is a recommended upgrade to jruby-openssl. A security problem
  involving peer certificate verification was found where failed
  verification silently did nothing, making affected applications
  vulnerable to attackers. Attackers could lead a client application
  to believe that a secure connection to a rogue SSL server is
  legitimate. Attackers could also penetrate client-validated SSL
  server applications with a dummy certificate. Your application would
  be vulnerable if you're using the 'net/https' library with
  OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER mode and any version of jruby-openssl
  prior to 0.6. Thanks to NaHi (NAKAMURA Hiroshi) for finding the
  problem and providing the fix. See
  http://www.jruby.org/2009/12/07/vulnerability-in-jruby-openssl.html
  for details.
- This release addresses CVE-2009-4123 which was reserved for the
  above vulnerability.
- Many fixes from NaHi, including issues related to certificate
  verification and certificate store purpose verification.
  - implement OpenSSL::X509::Store#set_default_paths
  - MRI compat. fix: OpenSSL::X509::Store#add_file
  - Fix nsCertType handling.
  - Fix Cipher#key_len for DES-EDE3: 16 should be 24.
  - Modified test expectations around Cipher#final.
- Public keys are lazily instantiated when the
  X509::Certificate#public_key method is called (Dave Garcia)
