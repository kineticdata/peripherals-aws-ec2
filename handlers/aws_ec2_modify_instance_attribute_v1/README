== AWS EC2 Modify Instance Attribute
    This handler is used to modify the specified attribute of the specified
    instance. You can specify only one attribute at a time.

=== Parameters
    [Dry Run]
      Dry run validates user permissions and inputs without completing the EC2
      action (true or false).
    [Instance ID]
      The ID of the instance.
    [Value]
      A new value for the attribute. Use only with the kernel, ramdisk,
      userData, disableApiTermination, or instanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior
      attribute.
    [Block Device Mappings]
      Modifies the DeleteOnTermination attribute for volumes that are currently
      attached. The volume must be owned by the caller. If no value is specified
      for DeleteOnTermination, the default is true and the volume is deleted
      when the instance is terminated. Format:
      [{&quot;device_name&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;,&quot;ebs&quot;:{&quot;volume_id&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;,&quot;delete_on_termination&quot;:true|false},&quot;virtual_name&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;,&quot;no_device&quot;:&quot;some value&quot;},...]
    [Source Destination Check]
      true or false. Specifies whether source/destination checking is enabled.
      A value of true means that checking is enabled, and false means checking
      is disabled. This value must be false for a NAT instance to perform NAT.
    [Disable API Termination]
      true or false. If the value is true, you can't terminate the instance
      using the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API; otherwise, you can. You cannot
      use this paramater for Spot Instances.
    [Instance Type]
      The instance type. Changes the instance type to the specified value.
      For more information, see Instance Types. If the instance type is not
      valid, the error returned is InvalidInstanceAttributeValue. For more
      information, see Instance Types in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User
      Guide online.
    [Kernel ID]
      Changes the instance's kernel to the specified value. AWS recommends that
       you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information,
       see PV-GRUB in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
    [Ramdisk ID]
      Changes the instance's RAM disk to the specified value. AWS recommends
      that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more
      information, see PV-GRUB in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
    [User Data]
      Changes the instance's user data to the specified value. Input is
      base64-encoded MIME data.
    [Instance Initiated Shutdown Behavior]
      Accepts 'stop' or 'terminate'.  Specifies whether an instance stops or
      terminates when you initiate shutdown from the instance (using the
      operating system command for system shutdown).
    [Security Group IDs]
      One or more security group names, separated by commas. Changes the
      security groups of the instance. You must specify at least one security
      group, even if it's just the default security group for the VPC. You must
      specify the security group ID, not the security group name.
    [EBS Optimized]
      true or false.  Specifies whether the instance is optimized for EBS I/O.
      This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an
      optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O performance.
      This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional
      usage charges apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.
    [SRIOV Net Support]
      Set to simple to enable enhanced networking for the instance. There is no
       way to disable enhanced networking at this time. This option is supported
       only for HVM instances. Specifying this option with a PV instance can
       make it unreachable.

=== Results
    This handler returns no results

=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the AWS REST API to modify the specified attribute of the
    specified instance. You can specify only one attribute at a time.  For more
    information see the AWS Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide online.

    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
