== AWS EC2 Revoke Security Group Ingress
    This handler uses the AWS REST API to Remove one or more ingress rules from
    a security group.

=== Parameters
    [Dry Run]
      Dry run validates user permissions and inputs without completing the EC2
      action (true or false).
    [Group Name]
        The name of the security group. Normally used for the EC2-Classic or the
        default VPC security group. Must match an existing value in AWS.
    [Group ID]
        The ID of the security group. Required for a non-default VPC.
    [Source Security Group Name]
        The name of the source security group. You can't specify this parameter
        in combination with the following parameters: the CIDR IP address range,
        the start of the port range, the IP protocol, and the end of the port
        range. For EC2-VPC, the source security group must be in the same VPC.
    [Source Security Owner ID]
      The AWS account ID for the source security group. For EC2-VPC, the source
      security group must be in the same VPC. You can't specify this parameter
      in combination with the following parameters: the CIDR IP address range,
      the IP protocol, the start of the port range, and the end of the port
      range. To revoke a specific rule for an IP protocol and port range, use
      a set of IP permissions instead.
    [IP Protocol]
      The IP protocol name (tcp, udp, icmp). Use -1 to specify all.
    [From Port]
      The start of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type
      number. For the ICMP type number, use -1 to specify all ICMP types.
    [To Port]
      The end of port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code
      number. For the ICMP code number, use -1 to specify all ICMP codes for
      the ICMP type.
    [CIDR IP Address Range]
      The CIDR IP address range. You can't specify this parameter when
      specifying a source security group.
=== Results
    This handler returns no results

=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the AWS REST API to Remove one or more ingress rules from
    a security group. The values that you specify in the revoke request
    (for example, ports) must match the existing rule's values for the rule to
    be removed. Each rule consists of the protocol and the CIDR range or source
    security group. For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the
    destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP protocol, you must also
    specify the ICMP type and code. Rule changes are propagated to instances
    within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay
    might occur.  This handler implements a subset of the full AWS call (single
    rule submission only).  For more information see the AWS Amazon Virtual
    Private Cloud User Guide online.

    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
