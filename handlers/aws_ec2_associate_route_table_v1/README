=== Detailed Description
Associates a subnet with a route table. The subnet and route must be in the same
VPC. This association causes traffic originating from the subnet to be routed
according to the routes in the route table. A route can be associated with
multiple subnets. For more information see the AWS Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
User Guide online.

The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
not have proper permissions.
