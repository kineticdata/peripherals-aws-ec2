== AWS EC2 Instance Retrieve Status
    This handler is used to retrieve the status of a particular EC2 instance.

=== Parameters
    [Dry Run]
      Dry run validates user permissions and inputs without completing the EC2
      action (true or false).
    [Instance ID]
      The instance id of the EC2 virtual machine that this handler will
      retrieve a status from

=== Results
    [Instance Status]

==== Sample Configuration
    Dry Run:                        true
    Instance ID:                    i-615670a7

=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the AWS REST API to retrieve the status of a particular
    EC2 instance.  The instance you are inquiring about is identified by its
    instance ID.  For more information see the AWS Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
    User Guide online.

    The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
    true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
    handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
    proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
    not have proper permissions.
