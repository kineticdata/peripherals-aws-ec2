== AWS EC2 Create Network Interface
  Associates a subnet with a route table.

=== Parameters
  [Dry Run]
    Dry run validates user permissions and inputs without completing the EC2
    action (true or false).
  [Subnet ID]
    The ID of the subnet to associate with the network interface.
  [Description]
    A description for the network interface.
  [Private IP Address (Primary)]
    The primary private IP address of the network interface. If you don't
    specify an IP address, Amazon EC2 selects one for you from the subnet range.
    If you specify an IP address, you cannot indicate any IP addresses specified
    in Private IP Addresses as primary (only one IP address can be designated as
    primary).
  [Security Group IDs]
    The IDs of one or more security groups, separated by commas.
  [Private IP Addresses]
    One or more private IP addresses in JSON format. Note: only one IP address
    can be designated as primary, and if you are using the 'Private IP Address
    (Primary)' as well as this field, that will be the primary --
    [{"private_ip_address":"IP address","primary":true},{"private_ip_address":"IP address","primary":false}]
  [Secondary Private IP Address Count]
    The number of secondary private IP addresses to assign to a network
    interface. When you specify a number of secondary IP addresses, Amazon EC2
    selects these IP addresses within the subnet range. You can't specify this
    option and specify more than one private IP address using Private IP Addresses.

=== Detailed Description
Creates a network interface in the specified subnet. For more information see
the Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute User Guide online.

The Dry Run parameter validates user permissions and inputs. If it is set to
true, an error will always be thrown by the handler before completing the
handler action. Error response will be 'DryRunOperation' if the account has
proper permissions and inputs; 'UnauthorizedOperation' if the account does
not have proper permissions.
